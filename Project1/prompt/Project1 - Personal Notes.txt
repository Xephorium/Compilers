Requirements:
  - First line of README.txt
  - Final Executable: scanner [file]
  - Structure:
    File: Scanner      // This is where the scanner lives
      > Contains FSA Table
      > Contains Driver Logic
      > Generates EOF Token when finished reading
    File: Token        // This is a Token data class
    File: TestScanner  // This is the test runner of the scanner class
      > Handles Input
      > Calls Scaner getToken() after pasing Input
      > Prints Each Token

New Filter
  Behavior
    - Strips out comments.
    - Tracks line number per character.
    - Newlines replaced by space, consecutive whitespace ignored.
    - Always one character ahead to read lookahead.
  Methods
    getCurrentCharacter()
    getLookaheadCharacter()
    iterate()

Remaining:
- Keywords

a=x

Current char   = 'a', code = 1
Lookahead char = '=', next code 101. Greater than 99, stop. Add 'a' token.

Current char   = '=', code = 3
Lookahead char = 'x', next code 103. Greater than 99, stop. Add '=' token.


==b

Current char   = '=', code = 3
Lookahead char = '=', next code 4. Valid! Continue.
Current char   = '=', code = 4
Lookahead char = 'b', next code 104. Greater than 99, stop. Add '==' token.
Current char   = 'b'...
